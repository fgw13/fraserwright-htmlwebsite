        <p>Hello, my name is Fraser wright. Born in Virginia to musical relatives, my interest in sonics began at an early age. I soon moved overseas to Kenya where I spent a large part of my childhood. This time overseas has greatly influenced my approach to both my music and photography. After moving back to the US I developed a passion for photography under the mentorship of Oregon-based painter and photographer Paula Bullwinkel in black and white analog processing. Since then I have been traveling between both east and west coasts of the US and developing my unique photography style through documenting my experiences. I currently live in New Orleans, studying music and continuing my photography as well as composing experimental ambient pieces of music.</p>
